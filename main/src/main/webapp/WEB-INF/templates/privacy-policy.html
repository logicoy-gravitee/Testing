                                 Welcome to Luvbrite Collective (&quot;Company,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) online platform. Company operates the online platform via Company&#39;s website located in Los Angeles, California (the &quot;Site&quot;, respectively), which is designed to facilitate the purchase and sale of purchase of cannabis products (&quot;Products&quot;) between buyers and licensed distributors of the Products. We have established this Privacy Policy as a means to describe to you our practices related to the information we collect from users of the Site, App and the online services enabled therein (the &quot;Services&quot;). So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase &quot;Personal Information&quot; in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that allows someone to identify or contact you (e.g., your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is associated with such information. When we use the phrase &quot;Anonymous Information&quot; in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information, such as aggregated, de-identified data. Note about Persons Under 21 The Site and App are not directed to persons under the age of 21 and persons under the age of 21 are not eligible to use our Services. We do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from persons under 21 years of age. If we later learn that a person under 21 years of age has submitted Personal Information to us, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the App, Site and the Services. How We Collect Information Information Your Provide to Us We collect Personal Information from you in the following ways: We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily when you register for the service and/or use the Services. For example, we will collect your name, email address, address, phone number, and password when you register for an account on the Services (an &quot;Account&quot;) You will also be required to upload a photograph of a valid, unexpired government-issued identification card verifying that you are 21 years of age or older and that matches the information you include upon registration of your Account. If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may collect, store and use that information. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can disable location services on your mobile device. When you communicate with us through our Site or App or by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Site or Services you are able to use. Information Automatically Collected Via Technology Log Files. As is true of most websites and applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (&quot;ISP&quot;), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users&#39; movements around the Website, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users&#39; needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Website or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. &quot;Cookies&quot; are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer&#39;s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Website. This type of information is collected to make the Website more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. Pixel Tags. In addition, we use &quot;Pixel Tags&quot; (also referred to as clear GIFs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user&#39;s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users&#39; Personal Information. Mobile Device. We may also collect information about your mobile device if you have downloaded the App, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information. In addition, the Services may access your device's image storage applications, with your consent, to facilitate your use of certain features of the Services. In addition, in the event our App crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to determine the reason that the App crashed, identify and fix bugs, and otherwise improve the performance of our App. This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
