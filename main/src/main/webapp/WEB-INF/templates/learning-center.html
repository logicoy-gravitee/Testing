								Cannabis is one of the oldest crops known to mankind, with
								records of its cultivation dating back thousands of years. The
								original classification of Cannabis was made by French biologist
								Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1785. Lamarck observed that certain
								marijuana plants from India were intoxicating and could be made
								into hashish. But traditional hemp crops, which were more common
								in Europe, had no euphoric effects. He came up with the name
								Cannabis indica to distinguish Indian Cannabis from European
								hemp, which was known at the time as Cannabis sativa. Likewise,
								Cannabis indica was specifically recognized as a therapeutic in
								Western medicine during the 1800s. <a

								Not everyone enjoys smoking, and those with compromised lung
								health may not even have the option. The stigma associated with
								smoking might be the only thing stopping some people from
								obtaining the benefits of the Cannabis plant. Accordingly, a
								variety of alternative consumption methods do exist. So, if your
								looking for an alternate route for consuming Cannabis, please

								Many organic herbs contain sought-after components that can be
								attained by smoking them. Smoking cannabis, in particular, has
								proven to have some positive benefits such as providing nausea
								and pain relief. However, there are always risks associated with
								inhaling burnt plant matter. Although we are ingesting some of
								the beneficial cannabinoids we seek, potential carcinogens and
								other toxins such as carbon monoxide &amp; dioxide, ammonia and
								other irritants are present in the smoke we inhale as well. <a
